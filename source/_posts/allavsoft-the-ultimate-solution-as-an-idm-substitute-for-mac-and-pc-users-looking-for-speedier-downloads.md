## Allavsoft: The Ultimate Solution as an IDM Substitute for Mac & PC Users Looking for Speedier Downloads

### Overview

Internet Download Manger, short for IDM, is a very popular video download manager which can manage and schedule downloads. Internet Download Manger can download online videos at very fast speed because it can divide downloads into multiple streams, can batch download online videos, and it supports almost all web browsers, like IE, Opera, Chrome, Safari, etc. However, this so good Internet Download Manger only works on Windows system, but not Mac system. So if users want to use IDM on Mac, they should search for an IDM alternative for Mac. And sometimes, Internet Download Manger for Windows does not work as it is expected and the following just lists some Internet Download Manger working failures:

* When I use Internet Download Manger to download YouTube video, Internet Download Manger helps to download a web page instead of the video. Why does this happen and how to correct it?
* Why Internet Download Manger only downloaded the audio, but no video. The original video plays fine on the web browser. What should I do to avoid this?
* Just now I tried to use IDM to download an online video, but instead of downloading the video, I got an error message saying "An error occurred while creating security connection". Did I operate IDM wrong?
* When I use IDM to download one online video, IDM only gets the commercial video to me, but not the actual main video. I have tried twice, but still failed. How can I use IDM to download the main video?

In view of the above, if you want to use an IDM Mac version and an IDM Windows alternative, you can try Allavsoft.
